# Deep-Learning Projects
This repository consists of some deep learning projects.
# Description
1. **CNN and Fine Tuning:** Here, we leveraged CNN and transfer learning algorithm to label the contents of the images using ResNet18 deep learning architecture by extracting features. Furthermore, test accuracy was improved from 75% to 92% by fine-tuning modelâ€™s parameters.

2. **Movie Embeddings:** Created movie embeddings from Movielens data. Loss was optimized using gradiend descent. After that, we plotted Loss as a function of iteration for different learning rates and choice of optimizers. Finally, cosine similarity was used to recommend movies.
